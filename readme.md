# DavidWebsiteBackend

A RESTful Go backend to track website visits. Each website visit contains a) the ip address of the user b) geographical information about that ip address (i.e. lat-lon, city, zipcode) and c) the date the user visited the website. The stack consists of a Go app deployed through heroku, and a [bolt.db](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) database deployed on the server. Heroku deployment is simple and bolt db makes requests fast and gets rid of the need for additional querying through sql. 

# Routes

### /visits
| Endpoint        | Method         | Description |
| :------------- | :-------------| :--------------------- |
| /visits        | POST         | Adds a new visit        |

The body of the request should have two parameters, `IpAddress` and `Location`, both as strings. There is no specific JSON structure assigned, which adds added flexibility for different use cases. For example, in one project I could write location as simply a city name i.e. 'Minneapolis' and in another I can strinify a bunch of JSON.

Example Request:
```sh
curl -H \
 "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -X POST -d '{"ipAddress": "123.456.789.1", "location": "TEST_LOCATION"}' \
 "http://localhost:5000/visits"
 # Response : {"ipAddress": "123.456.789.1", "location": "TEST_LOCATION"}
```

### /visits/ip/{ip} (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

| Endpoint        | Method         | Description |
| :------------- | :-------------| :--------------------- |
| /visits/ip/:ip | GET          | Gets visit by ip address|

A quick way to get all the visits of by a specific IP address. Note that there is an added value Timestamp

Example request:
```sh
curl "http://localhost:5000/visits/ip/123.456.789.1"
# Response :
# [
#  {
#    "Data": "{\"ipAddress\":\"123.456.789.1\",\"location\":\"TEST_LOCATION}",
#    "Timestamp": "2017-12-27T14:08:28-06:00"
#  }
#]
```

### /visits (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

| Endpoint        | Method         | Description           | Query strings|
| :------------- | :-------------| :---------------------  | :----- |
| /visits      | GET             | Lists all visits        | ip, to, from |

Gets all visits, filterable by ip address and dates as query strings. Note that `to` and `from` are not inputed as dates, but rather negative integers which translate to the number of 'days ago', i.e. `-7` means 'seven days ago'.

Example Request: (all visits from `123.456.789.1` within the last year and yesterday)
```sh
curl "http://localhost:5000/visits?ip=123.456.789.1&to=-1&from=-365"
# Response
# [
#  {
#    "Data": "{\"ipAddress\":\"123.456.789.1\",\"location\":\"TEST_LOCATION}",
#    "Timestamp": "2017-12-27T14:08:28-06:00"
#  },
#  {
#    "Data": "{\"ipAddress\":\"123.456.789.1\",\"location\":\"TEST_LOCATION}",
#    "Timestamp": "2017-10-27T14:08:28-06:00"
#  }
#]
```

# Development

### Setup

This go project uses `mongoDB` as a data store and `heroku` for deployment and configuration management.

1. Download the project using go

```sh
# download src
cd $GOPATH/src
go get github.com/dgoldstein1/websiteAnalytics-backend
# cd into directory
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dgoldstein1/websiteAnalytics-backend
# install dependencies
go get
```

2. Launch MongoDB instance
 
To start a local instance of mongo, download and install the [command line interface](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Then run the following commands to get the db up and running locally:

```sh
mongod # start the service
mongo  # in a new tab, connect and start mongo
use websitevisits # create 'websitevists' db
```

3.  Heroku 

To setup heroku, follow [the heroku setup guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-go#set-up) to install the cli. Then run the following:

```sh
heroku login
# compile the go code
go install 
# start the dev server on port 5000
heroku local
```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:5000. Running `curl http://localhost:5000/visits` should give you `[]` as there are no current visits in the mongo db.

### Testing

Each endpoint is tested using a suite of integration tests. To run them, first start a dev server :

```sh
go install && heroku local
```

In a seperate terminal window from the root directory of the project, run the following :

```sh
# from a new window
test/run_tests.sh {port number} # port is usually 5000
# output
loading test data...
{test data}
done
--- SUCCESS --- retrieve all visits
--- SUCCESS --- add a new visit
```

Ro rerun tests, you must delete the test data from the 'websitevisits' db store. From your terminal run,

```

I'm working on better solution for this : https://github.com/dgoldstein1/websiteAnalytics-backend/issues/3

### Deployment

This project is continuously deployed with every push or merge to `master`.

1. Mongo

To deploy a new instance, create a new mongo db on [https://mlab.com/](mongo lab) named 'websitevisits'. A free version is fine as this project does not consume a lot of memory. This will be the deployed app's datastore.

2.  Heroku

```sh
heroku login
# create new app on heroku
heroku create
Creating app... done, â¬¢ thawing-inlet-61413
https://thawing-inlet-61413.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/thawing-inlet-61413.git
```

This creates a new heroku app. Before we can deploy code to it, we need to update the configuration settings.

3. Configure Environment Variables

Open up the app configuration settings on the  [heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and set the following config variables :

| Name        | Value         |
| :------------- | :-------------|
| DATABASE_URL      | mongodb://${dbuser}:${dbpassword}@ds255787.mlab.com:55787/${dbname}          |
| LOGGER      | true              |
| PORT      | 5000              |

For `mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds255787.mlab.com:55787/websitevisits` git this from `mongo lab` and replace `<dbuser>`, `<dbpassword>`, and `<dbname>` with the user you wish to access the db fromm and the db name. *Note -- these are the credentials from the `add database user` button on mlab*

4. Deploy the app

```sh
# push the code to your remote
git push heroku master
